## Introduction
When on Wednesday 11th March 2020, the Director-General of The World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, declared the fast-spreading corona virus outbreak to be a pandemic likely to spread to all the countries on our planet, it was just a question of time before schools, colleges and universities were closed to stop the spread of the virus. Thailand’s schools, colleges and universities were closed initially for two weeks from 18th March to 31st March as announced by the Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha on Tuesday 17th March (Channel News Asia [CAN], 2020). The closure was later extended until 1st July 2020. In Bangladesh the deputy Education Minister, Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury announced an initial closure of all educational institutions from 17-31 March (Sakib, 2020) this was later extended until predictably September 2020 (The Business Standard [TBS], 2020). Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, The Philippines, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Sri Lanka all closed their schools and universities late February to March 2020 (University World News, 2020).

In both Thailand and Bangladesh, universities’ closure meant that many students had to switch to online learning. In Thailand private and state universities were instructed to shift classes online by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science Research and Innovation (Mala, 2020). In Bangladesh, most of the three hundred and fifty thousand students’ studied at private universities started online classes as soon as they were closed for face-to-face classes (Jasim, 2020).

The purpose of this study is to identify possible factors that influence the teachers’ transition. The outcomes from the analytical findings are expected to be useful for the practising teachers and institutional authorities for designing an effective transition plan. Thus, “what are the affecting factors for teachers’ successful transition from face-to-face to online teaching?” is formulated as the research question. Outcomes of this study include the factors that influence the teachers’ transition. A set of inspectional recommendations is formulated for informing institutions when planning training programs for online teaching or in the preparation of the online teaching guides of the government or non-governmental agencies.

In this article, the literature review section summarises relevant texts on teachers’ learning patterns and their dynamics in a crisis. The next section is about research methodology followed by results from the statistical tests, which leads to a discussion on the findings and, finally, the conclusion of the study.
