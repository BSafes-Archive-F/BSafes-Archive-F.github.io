## Literature review
As this study investigates the on-the-job learning of lecturers making a sudden and unexpected transition from the classroom to online teaching, the existing literature on learning theories, learning specific to teachers, learning due to crises was examined. The differences between online and classroom teaching were also studied.

### *How we learn*
There are three overlapping and interconnected theories about how we learn a) behaviourist, b) cognitive and c) constructivism (Celikoz et al., 2019). Thorndike developed the stimulus-response theory in which animals and the man received a stimulus and responded to it. Skinner placed great importance on identifying the factors in the environment that caused a particular behavioural response and the reinforcement given due to a specific behaviour. Tolman, in his 1932 book Purposive Behaviour in Animals and Men, explained how behaviour could be adapted according to what takes place in the environment and the purpose of that behaviour. Tolman was the first behaviourist to recognise a cognitive process.

Others have placed a greater emphasis on the cognitive part of learning process. Jean Piaget is generally credited with developing the cognitive learning theory also known as cognitive constructivism (von Glasersfeld, 1974). Piaget believed that knowledge is actively constructed by learners based on their existing cognitive structures. Therefore, he challenged the behaviourists who only focused on behaviour that could be observed and thus measured. Piaget looked at the mental processes between a stimulus and the response and noted that their prior learning and development stage would influence or modify the knowledge to be constructed from a learning experience (Philips, 1995).

Some constructivists saw the cultural development of the learner as more critical in the learning process. Lev Vygotsky (1978) developed the theory of social constructivism in which the learner builds new knowledge based on an interaction with their culture and society. Finally, the best known radical constructivism theorist Ernest (1994) saw knowledge as being constructed based on existing knowledge and invented to help us function in our own environment. However, he did not see such knowledge as necessarily being based on any kind of reality.

This study, whilst acknowledging the importance of behaviourist and cognitive learning theories, has adopted a broad constructivist approach towards leaning theory in the sense that lecturers are viewed as responsible for evaluating their performance, being active in the process of constructing new knowledge being influenced by their previous experiences including their cultural and social background. Most teachers learn precisely the same way as other people, (Bransford et al., 2000), yet the existing literature provides more details of learning methods that are especially useful for teachers.

### *How teachers learn*
There are two main ways in which teachers learn 1) from their experiences as they teach (Dewey, 1963) and 2) interactions with other teachers (Feiman-Nemser & Parker, 1993). Teachers get knowledge and understanding from their daily contacts with their pupils, the institutions, their practical experiences with curricula, syllabi, teaching resources, and evaluating and grading of student’s performance. Teachers are continually reflecting on such experiences and revising their practice in light of their evaluations. Considerably different findings are found in the work of Firing et al. (2015) where Norwegian soldiers had to wait for the debriefing after dealing with a terrorist attack on the island of Utoya before they could begin the learning process. Teachers have opportunities to learn a great deal from each other’s personal experiences. This might be through formal mentoring in which a more experienced teacher takes a recruit and guides them with advice and knowledge or, more often through informal methods such as conversations between colleagues in the staff room or over lunch. In addition to these two main methods for teachers to learn, some learning occurs through in-service training or further study such as completing a higher degree course or even from other experiences such as becoming a parent (Bransford et al., 2000).

### *Differences between face-to-face and online teaching*
There is a considerable body of literature on the differences between teaching online and in a traditional face-to-face classroom. Whilst much of it is relevant to this study, it is essential to emphasise that the existing literature is based on teachers and students who have mainly volunteered to teach online and for courses that their institutions have had time to plan. This differs from the COVID-19 lock down situation in which all institutions, teachers and students had to go online whether they wanted to or not and in which courses designed for a face-to-face classroom had to suddenly be moved online with little or no opportunity to amend the course structure or materials before their online launch. This point is well illustrated in the institutions that have made a planned transition from the classroom to online teaching have been involved in considerable financial investments to set-up and support such courses (Siedlaczek, 2004). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities in lock down had to make an almost overnight switch using whatever resources were in place at the time such as teacher’s and student’s Wi-Fi connections, laptops and smart phones (Sari & Nayir, 2020).

The importance of technology was also talked about at length along with the need for hardware that worked efficiently, software that was user friendly and technical support with a clear structure in terms of roles and responsibilities. Many of the teachers in the Siedlaczek study enjoyed the professional development opportunities posed by learning how to utilise new technologies into their teaching, but this might not apply to all teachers involved in the current study as the switch to online teaching involved not only enthusiastic volunteers, but also teachers who might well have been reluctant or nervous about such change.

### *How a crisis can affect learning*
The concept of a crisis relates to a situation in which some kind of threat or uncertainty is present with an unexpected and destabilising element (Schiffino et al., 2017). There is conventional wisdom that when humans are placed in a crisis, they learn more quickly. This idea might seem to be based entirely on circumstantial evidence such as during the Black Death Sir Isaac Newton was forced to leave Cambridge and whilst at home he saw an apple fall from a tree in the garden which led to the discovery of the law of gravity or the first computer invention during the Second World War (Fisher, 2020). However, there is more scientific evidence from the literature to support the concept that humans and animals learn faster during a crisis. Baum and Dahlin (2017) postulated that a crisis would initiate learning and change using the knowledge and experience gained during the event. Schiffino et al. (2017) used a series of games to analyze post-crisis learning and found that individuals can learn from and implement what they have learnt from a crisis.

Most of the research on learning from a crisis focuses on how organisations learn rather than individuals (Schiffino et al., 2017). Many organisations have very formalised and centralised systems to enable them to learn from any crisis and implement such learning. This is illustrated by Firing, Moen and Skarsvag (2015) who found that members of the Norwegian armed forces had restricted learning opportunities from a crisis caused by a terrorist attack on the island of Utoya on 22nd July 2011 due to the structure of the debriefing organised by the army. After the attack those involved were debriefed and it was the soldiers’ potential learning opportunities to learn from each other.

A qualitative study by Hos and Cinabas (2018) throws more light on how individual learn from a crisis. Hos and Cinabas used in-depth interviews, observations and content analysis to ascertain how teachers learnt to teach Syrian refugees in Turkey during a crisis caused by war. The children were 4-6 years old who received support by the Turkish language and literacy development. The study revealed the teachers had learned to overcome challenges such as having no place to teach the children. Problem-solving was used to divide the children into small groups and teaching staff on a shift basis. The participants celebrated small achievements that helped them do this, teachers searched online for ideas and support. Such reflection allowed them to improve their teaching and help the children integrate into society. Both teachers and administrators felt that the learning had taken place due to their experience on the job.

Psychological research suggests that when faced with a threat learning will be enhanced in other ways. Abend et al. (2013) carried out tests using dot probes with neutral and angry faces followed by target probes that had to be neutralised as quickly as possible. As angry faces always appeared at the targets an association was formed between targets and a threat. Compared with a control group, the group experiencing a threat rapidly improved on the task and achieved learning saturation. Furthermore, these improvements were maintained over a long time, showing how learning under threat can improve performance and memory retention. Starita et al. (2019) worked with 25 participants in which they were subjected to threat conditioning and supervised memory recognition tests. Pictures of animals and tools were used along with a shock to create a threat whilst other pictures contained no shock and were used as within-subject control. The next day a memory test was used in which participants were shown similar pictures to the previous day, some from the shock set and others from the control or non-shock set. Starita et al. (2019) found that threat conditioning resulted in generalisation of episodic memory, an active process in which earlier conditioned learning from a threat can activate episodic memory representations of aversive experiences. Starita et al. (2019) thus support the idea that humans rapidly learn from threats and make generalisations from such learning. Learning in a crisis can accelerate certain types of learning and the existing literature suggests that this can take place during the crises itself such as in the case of the teachers working with Syrian refugee children or post-crisis or in case of the Norwegian soldiers. This study will focus on if, what and how lecturers learnt during the COVID19 pandemic as they transitioned from classroom to online teaching.

### *Teaching transition during COVID-19 pandemic*
Müller et al. (2021) found in their research that the transition of teaching learning during the period of COVID-19 pandemic was not easy. Creating pre-recorded lectures, making digital content, drafting a script and recording a video with necessary editing hugely contributed to the increased workload of teachers. Other difficult activities during the transition include assessments and marking in higher-order learning, limited ability to observe students during synchronous sessions and constantly monitor various inputs. In the same research it was also mentioned that teacher’s self familiarising with the vast amount of new technologies and potential pedagogies, especially applicable in online teaching, had been hard and time consuming. Sari and Nayir (2020) mentioned higher education institutions made the overnight switch using whatever technological resources were available for both teachers and students. Institutional support for pedagogical approach is not very relevant as the institutions have a standard of pedagogy in their policy. During the pandemic, necessary modifications in pedagogy were not sufficiently addressed. On the other hand, teachers’ training is important for adopting technology and pedagogy. Significance of teacher training for online teaching was justified and suggested for the teachers during the COVID-19 period (Nantschev et al., 2020). Institutional support was essential for the teachers to convert contents and teaching approach from face-to-face to online teaching (San-Martin et al., 2020). The authors also stated that the universities were willing to adopt technology and provide support to teachers for online teaching. However, the similar contemporary research works do not include designing and planning of a course, as a factor, to be taught in the changed setting of online education. Authors of this research identified this as a gap in relevant studies. Course design and planning for online teaching was taken into consideration as a positive influential factor towards successful transition. In addition, the classroom management was also considered as a factor of the transition, which was not properly addressed in contemporary research works on the context of higher education during COVID-19 pandemic. Both of these research gap factors are discussed in the following section of variable definitions.

### *Definitions of variables and hypotheses*
This study was intended to find the factors influencing the successful transition in teaching from face-to-face to online. The dependent variable ***‘success in online teaching’***  is hypothetically influenced by a set of 9 independent variables.

***Professional training:*** Teachers need to have professional training on online teaching. Importance of training for effective teaching in general was described in scholarly articles. In-service training or further study was an influential factor of performing better as teachers (Bransford et al., 2000). In the context of mathematics teaching during the COVID-19 period, it was justified that teacher training was essential for online teaching (Nantschev et al., 2020). Alternative hypothesis (H1) was ‘professional training’ of teachers would positively affect the ‘success in online teaching’.

***Perception on teach-learn:*** Teachers’ perception on the learning process of students and how effective teaching takes place was taken as a probable factor. Learning theories and their practices in education are the major sources of teachers’ perception (Celikoz et al., 2019). It was perceived by the teachers that a crisis situation initiates and expedites learning activities (Schiffino et al., 2017). In a recently published research article, claimed as the first study to investigate the effects of the sudden transition from in-class to only online education from teachers’ and students’ perceptions, Lauret and Bayram-Jacobs (2021) found compelling evidence. Alternative hypothesis (H2) was ‘perception on teach-learn’ of the teachers would positively affect the ‘success in online teaching’.

***Performance evaluation:*** Students performance evaluation is an integral part of teaching and learning. The teaching learning process can be successful only when the evaluation is done through proper assessment methods. Challenges are increased in the online education setting. Performance evaluation was recognised as an important factor of the teaching process during COVID-19 pandemic period (Pócsová et al., 2021). Alternative hypothesis (H3) was ‘performance evaluation’ of the students would positively affect the ‘success in online teaching’.

***Student centred activities:*** Learners’ motivation is the driving force to learn in the teaching learning process when it is student centred. The process was found as augmented in a crisis situation (Hos & Cinabas, 2018). It was also found from a before-and-after survey that the learners’ motivation, in a student centred teaching process, to deal with the subject topics by increased complexity and workload remained stable (Li, 2021). Alternative hypothesis (H4) was ‘student centred activities’ would positively affect the ‘success in online teaching’.

***Course design & planning:*** Designing the course activities by making a plan of lectures and contents was taken into the list of probable factors. Course design was considered as an influential factor especially in the sudden transition period of teaching from face-to-face to online. The authors did not find sufficient literature supports on this. Thus, this probable factor was taken as a new dynamic in the context by filling up the research gap. Alternative hypothesis (H5) was ‘course design & planning’ by the teachers would positively affect the ‘success in online teaching’.

***Cheating concern in exam:*** Teachers’ concern about cheating in online exams and quizzes is an added reality in the online education setting. Teachers need to prepare assessment tools with innovations and by accepting extensive workloads. Assessing every student with individual question could be a solution in the context of reasonable class size. Exam duration was a parameter of evaluation in online examination with the learning management system used (Pócsová et al., 2021). Alternative hypothesis (H6) was ‘cheating concern in exam’ to the teachers would negatively affect the ‘success in online teaching’.

***Infrastructure difficulties:*** Appropriate digital devices with workable internet connection facilities are the basic requirements for online education. These infrastructure facilities are required for both teachers and students. Institutions are primarily responsible for facilitating the need situation. Universities needed to invest substantially for the transition from face-to-face to online (Siedlaczek, 2004) and had provided laptops, smart phones and WiFi connections for teachers and students in applicable cases (Sari & Nayir, 2020). However, such investments and supports provided by the educational institutions may not be sufficient in every society. Alternative hypothesis (H7) was ‘infrastructure difficulties’ of both teachers and students perceived by the teachers would negatively affect the ‘success in online teaching’.

***Lack of students’ knowhow:*** Teachers expect their students are familiar enough with the technological environment and the applications necessary to be used. Students’ technological knowhow, being aware of opportunities that technology and technological tools offer for education for a particular concept and level, supported how and when various technology and technological tools could support or hinder students’ learning during COVID-19 (Lauret & Bayram-Jacobs, 2021). Alternative hypothesis (H8) was ‘lack of students’ knowhow’ perceived by the teachers would negatively affect the ‘success in online teaching’.

***Difficult class management:*** Classroom management is a common pedagogical term. However, this is a new phenomenon in the context of online teaching with a number of dynamics including students’ active participation, privacy of students and teachers, cyber security and effective communication. The authors did not find sufficient research supports on this issue, which was eventually taken as a factor to fill up the research gap. Alternative hypothesis (H9) was ‘difficult class management’ by the teachers would negatively affect the ‘success in online teaching’.
