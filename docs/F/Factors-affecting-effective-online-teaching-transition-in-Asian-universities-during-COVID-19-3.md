## Method
The researchers intended to identify the factors of teachers’ transition to online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a quantitative survey.

### *Data*
Non-probability purposeful sampling was used for selecting 68 lecturers who participated in this study. The justifications for choosing participants selected by purposeful sampling described by McMillan and Schumacher (1993) as "They are likely to be knowledgeable and informative about the phenomena the researcher is investigating". In this case, the participants had to be teaching online in higher educational institutions and from different countries in Asia. These lecturers all had to adapt to the sudden change in teaching methodology from face-to-face to online.

The questionnaire used in this study was developed by modifying statements from the TALIS Teacher Questionnaire (OECD, 2013). The first draft of the questionnaire was then submitted to a panel of experts in teaching online. The panel was tasked with making judgments on whether the research topic's important aspects had been covered. Lyn (1986) advised that a panel consists of a minimum of three experts. In this study, five experts were engaged. Each expert was asked to rate the relevance of the statements to the content by using a five-point scale. The draft questionnaire was rewritten following the panel's advice and re-submitted in which 100% highly relevant rating was achieved. The researchers used a pilot of 30 lecturers to test reliability and internal consistency. From the completed pilot study questionnaires, the calculated Cronbach's alpha was found as 0.84. Later, from the actual data set of all 68 respondents, the point estimated Cronbach’s alpha from all variables was found as 0.72. Scores above 0.7 were considered for consistency measurement (Wiersma, 1995). The survey was conducted between September and December in 2020. The questionnaire includes both the structured and open-ended questions.

The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee and all participants provided informed consent before entering the data collection form. The data were collected anonymously by using Google forms, and participants' confidentiality was assured at every stage of the research.

### *Analytical procedure*
The study was built on a prediction design approach that used a correlation study with dependent and independent variables based on a cause-and-effect relationship (Beins, 2017). Spearman’s correlation tool was used as the variables were of rank-ordered using a 5-point Likert scale. Stepwise regression tests were employed to explore the significant association between the factors that influence the success in online teaching.

### *Socio-demographic and other relevant variables*
The demographic and teaching information of the 68 participants is shown, in the Table 1, with the variables and their respective groups.
