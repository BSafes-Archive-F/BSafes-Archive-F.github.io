## Results
From the descriptive statistics as shown in Table 1, it is observed that nearly 56% of all respondents were at least 40 years by age. Only 6% of the respondents were new teachers with less than one year of teaching experience. On the other hand, nearly 34% of the teachers had more than 20 years of teaching experience while 82% had at least 3 years of teaching experience. There was quite a variety in the disciplines of courses or subjects taught by the responding teachers. The spread of discipline overlapped in some cases. The program levels also overlapped in some cases as some teachers taught courses at two different program levels. More than 80% of the teachers taught the courses for undergraduate and graduate levels. More than 70% of the respondents did not have online teaching experience before the COVID-19 crisis period.

### *Factors influencing success in online teaching*
Spearman rank-order correlation test was conducted. All nine independent variables were considered for the correlation test with the dependent variable. Only significant correlations are shown in Table 2. The full correlation results are found in the Table 3 of Appendix.

### *Step-wise regression analysis*
According to the Table 4 shown in the Appendix, adjusted R-sq values are 0.000, 0.366, 0.484 and 0.514 in four models. For the auto-correlation among independent variables, the Durbin-Watson values are reported as 1.930, 1.854, 2.012 and 2.304 respectively. The regression co-efficient of ‘professional training’, ‘performance evaluation’, ‘cheating concern’, ‘infrastructure difficulties’, ‘lack of students’ knowhow’ and ‘difficult class management’ are 0.271, 0.377, -0.331, -0.248, - 0.246 and -0.412 respectively. The level of statistical significance was less than 0.001 in every case. The alternative hypotheses one, three, six, seven, eight and nine were confirmed accordingly. Eventually, the hypotheses two, four and five did not retain. The predictors ‘professional training’ and ‘performance evaluation’ influence the ‘success in online teaching’ in the same direction. Other predictors ‘cheating concern’, ‘infrastructure difficulties’, ‘lack of students’ knowhow’ and ‘difficult class management’ influence the ‘success in online teaching’ in opposite direction.
