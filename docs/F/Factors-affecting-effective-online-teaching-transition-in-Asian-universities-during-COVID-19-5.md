## Discussion
### *On demography and descriptive statistics*
More than half of the teachers were at least 40 years old and had at least 11 years of teaching experience. Thus, most of the responses were from seasoned practitioners in the higher education teaching profession. Professionals from most fields can understand the changes they need to make in their respective disciplines allowing them to manage the changes by learning new required skills and knowledge. This learning behaviour was supported by Bransford et al. (2000) and also by John Dewey (1963).

There were quite wide varieties in the subjects taught by the lecturers in this study and the levels of programs in which they taught. However, this study did not find significant variations in the transition activities from face-to-face to online classes in terms of the subject taught or the program level. More than 70% of teachers did not have experience of teaching online before the COVID-19 crisis. Interestingly, most of these teachers were well planned for the online classes though they did not think the online classes could be as effective as face-to-face classes.

### *On correlation test results*
‘Success in online teaching’ had a weak and positive correlation (0.442) with ‘professional training’ (Moore et al., 2013). From the underlying dimensions it was found that the majority of the teachers who conducted useful individual or joint educational researches in the previous two years time thought that the online classes could be as effective as in face-to-face learning. This finding supported Bransford et al. (2000) observations that the teachers’ learning could occur through in-service training or further study. A recent article has suggested that higher education institutions should allocate resources and funding for professional development, which may include include subscriptions to online software, online teaching-learning tools, online collaboration and video conferencing tools (Al-Naabi et al., 2021).

There was a moderate and positive relationship (0.566) between ‘success in online teaching’ and ‘performance evaluation’ (Moore et al., 2013). Nantschev et al. (2020) also found similar results as in this study that the teachers’ pedagogical knowledge on teaching and students evaluation significantly influences the teaching learning process.

‘Success in online teaching’ had a moderate and negative correlation (-0.533) with ‘cheating concern in exam’. By the underlying dimensions, teachers reported that the cheating concern in the exams was possible to mitigate by variety of questions and time constraints. This was supported by Pócsová et al. (2021).

There was a weak and negative relationship (-0.436) between ‘success in online teaching’ and ‘infrastructure difficulty’. From the underlying dimensions it was found that Students’ slow internet connection, inadequate or inappropriate devices of students, insufficient infrastructure facilities provided by the educational institutions were the obstructing factors to successful online teaching. This finding of the study contradicts Siedlaczek (2004) findings where a certain amount of institutional investment and infrastructural facilities were suggested for building a platform of online classes.

‘Success in online teaching’ had a weak and negative correlation (-0.421) with ‘lack of students’ knowhow’ (Moore et al., 2013). Students’ comfort levels were found influenced by the use of digital devices and internet connection facilities. Sari and Nayir (2020) found the similar factors in their qualitative research article on challenges of distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

There was a moderate and negative relationship (-0.606) between ‘success in online teaching’ and ‘difficult class management’ (Moore et al., 2013). Among the correlations, ‘difficult class management’ was the highest in value, though not strong in statistical interpretation. The other three independent variables ‘perception on teach-learn’, ‘student centred activities’ and ‘course design & planning’ were not significantly influential to the dependent variable ‘success in online teaching’.

### *On step-wise regression results*
Adjusted R-sq values ensure that the linear regression can explain 36.6% to 51.4% variance in the data. Durbin-Watson values are close to 2.0 and lie within the critical range of 1.5 < DW < 2.5 that ensures no first order linear auto-correlation among the independent variables (Gujarati & Porter, 2009). According to the regression values found, one unit increment in ‘professional training’ will increase 0.271 units in ‘success in online teaching’; one unit increment in ‘performance evaluation’ will increase 0.377 units in ‘success in online teaching’; one unit increment in ‘cheating concern in exam’ will decrease 0.331 units in ‘success in online teaching’; one unit increment in ‘infrastructure difficulties’ will decrease 0.248 units in ‘success in online teaching’; one unit increment in ‘lack of students’ knowhow’ will decrease 0.246 units in ‘success in online teaching’; and one unit increment in ‘difficult class management’ will decrease 0.412 units in ‘success in online teaching’.

### *Overall discussion*
Despite some significant differences between the existing literature and this study’s context many points remain pertinent to this paper. Siedlaczek (2004) held focus group meetings with in-depth follow-up interviews of college lecturers who had both face-to-face and online teaching experiences. The teachers involved in this study expressed the view that the institution needed to have policies developed for online courses specifically rather than merely adapting existing faceto-face policies. The teachers also expressed the need for considerable flexibility and adaptability in course design and noted that teachers who taught in a face-to-face context using a lecture-based style might have more difficulty successfully switching to online teaching.

Interestingly, in contradiction to the study’s quantitative findings, teachers expressed in openended responses that a student centred learning environment would be more supportive to the success in online teaching. They suggested more online courses on professional development. This should have rapidly changed into a more student centred approach in which students took on greater responsibility for their learning. Teachers also noted that the students who were wellmotivated and had considerable self-discipline were more successful at online learning.
