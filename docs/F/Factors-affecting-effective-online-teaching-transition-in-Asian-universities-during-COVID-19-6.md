## Conclusion
During the COVID-19 crisis, the online class was the only alternative solution to carry on academic activities in higher education institutions of Asian countries including Bangladesh and Thailand. Teachers had to abruptly transform for teaching online by gaining new skills and making necessary adjustments in teaching-learning methods and students’ evaluation. This study tried to identify influential factors in successful teachers’ transition from face-to-face teaching to online. Several experienced teachers in some Asian higher education institutions were surveyed and some inspectional recommendations were made on the findings. These recommendations are expected to be used for the policy-making of effective online classes by educational institutions. Also the teachers can accept this study’s observations to prepare themselves for effective online classes.

### *Practical implications*
The authors have formulated the following recommendations for different stakeholders including policy makers and implementers.

• Teachers and academic staff in higher education will redesign their teaching and students’ evaluation planning for effective learning. 

• University managements will restructure the teaching learning facilities especially appropriate for the online education setting. 

• Universities will reallocate infrastructure facilities by providing necessary devices and internet connectivity for both students and teachers. 

• Teachers and students will recognise the importance of responsible behaviours in performance evaluation process and act accordingly to improve the quality of evaluation. 

• Students will restore confidence in classroom management by active, self-directed and accountable participations in online learning.

### *Limitation*
The survey scope was not wide-spread and could be extended to include more participants from a more number of countries and thereby increase the general applicability of the statistical tests’ results. Variations of teachers’ comfort in using proper technological tools by the teachers’ subject affiliations were not addressed in this study. Subject affiliations of the teachers, from their academic lives, may have influences on efficient use of technology in their teaching profession. Likewise, deviations in effective use of technology in online teaching based on teachers’ age range were not identified. Abilities and motivation for learning may vary in the age ranges of teachers, which may influence adapting themselves in online teaching by using new technological tools and digital devices.

### *Future research direction*
The authors hope more research activities will be conducted on the topic of successful online teaching in higher education for finding better conclusions. In a recent research it was recognised that, a positive attitude and high self-efficacy beliefs were found to have facilitated the switch to online teaching (Kaqinari et al., 2021). More research would be the source of recommendations for designing a proper setup for successful online teaching learning. Similarly, it is also expected that sufficient research will be conducted in secondary and higher secondary levels as the online teaching learning is being extended in all education levels.
