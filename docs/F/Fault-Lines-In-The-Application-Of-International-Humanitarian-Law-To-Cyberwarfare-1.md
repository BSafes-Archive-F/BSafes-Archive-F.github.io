## 1. INTRODUCTION
*A sword never kills anybody: it is a tool in the killer’s hand. (Lucius A. Seneca)*

International Humanitarian Law (IHL) consists of a body of rules, both conventional and customary, that regulates the conduct of belligerents during an armed conflict by prohibiting the use of certain methods means of warfare. The term war is deliberately omitted for a war-like situation might exist even when there is no formal declaration of war. So, to determine the applicability of IHL, it is quintessential to determine the onset of an armed conflict. The test for it was laid down by International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the *Tadic*<sup>1</sup> case in the following words:

> “An armed conflict exists when states resort to force in their relations *inter se* or when there is a protracted armed violence between governmental forces and organized armed groups or between such groups only.”

The said criterion also implies classifying armed conflicts broadly into international armed conflict (IAC) or an armed conflict not of an international character (NIAC also termed internal armed conflict). The said classification is essential for there are different laws applicable to each kind of conflict. Many of the treaty-based provisions have attained the status of customary norms, and as such, they bind all states equally<sup>2</sup>. However, many states are yet to ratify the Additional Protocols, and the provisions therein are not customary, and as such, they are binding only onto the states who have ratified them. The drafters intended to regulate physical warfare, and the modern warfare mediums like cyberspace were not known then.

The technological sophistication has enabled States to develop new weapons, and the law governing the use of such weapons needs to be exhaustive enough to adapt to changing circumstances<sup>3</sup> (Kathleen, 2006). Notwithstanding the relatively lesser number of scenarios where states have acknowledged the employment of cyber warfare during an armed conflict, the debate on the legal issues incidental to the conflicts involving cyberspace is high (Gisel, 2020). Cyberwarfare is referred to as the fifth domain of warfare, the other conventional domains being the land, air, sea, and outer space. Cyberspace offers virtual connectivity independent of territorial limits. With the multiple benefits of such interconnectivity comes the drawbacks, such as the users in interface with the network can easily be targeted where ever they are (Dinniss, 2008). There is always a possibility of a bug in the product unknown to manufacturers at the time of release, which the attacker can exploit for various purposes. For

<sup>2</sup> October 1995, para 70. 2The core IHL treaties include the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907; Geneva Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, 1949; the Geneva Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick, and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, 1949; the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, 1949; The Geneva Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, 1949; Three Additional Protocols shortened as AP I, APII, AP III.

<sup>3</sup> Article 36 of Additional Protocol I obliges State Parties to review the legality of employment of any new weapon at each of the state of the study, development, acquisition and adoption. This is because the combatants are not given absolute freedom in choosing means and methods of warfare under article 22 of the 1907 Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, and Article 35(1) of Additional Protocol I.

instance, the attacker succeeds in penetrating the main server of a hospital, and thereby all the interconnected devices are compromised, even the pacemaker installed inside the patient’s body. Through command and control software, the attacker can even break down the pacemaker’s functioning, which will ultimately result in the patient’s death in the absence of any backup. So one can speak volumes of the human costs of wired or cyber operations<sup>4</sup> . This calls for an in-depth dwelling into the potential issue that the world would probably come across in the near future as all states, from giant economies to the poor and developing nations, are enhancing their cyber capabilities.

Cyber operations do not take part in a legal vacuum as they are becoming part of modern-day armed conflicts, which demands the evolutionary interpretation of IHL. This paper focuses on some significant debates in the study of IHL in cyberwarfare. Firstly, the history of cyber-attacks is briefly discussed to tell readers about the onset of debate. Introducing cyberwarfare is followed by a brief discussion on how the network functions and types of attacks based on purposes. The very terms "attack" and "object" in the cyber context are analyzed in detail as they form the basis of every provision of LOAC. The contemporary debates as to the interpretation of these terms are included in the scope of the present study. Lastly, the attribution issue in cyberwarfare is analyzed to introduce the reader to the difficulty involved in classifying the armed conflict, which is crucial because there is a different set of rules applicable to each class of armed conflict. The study ends with the recommendation that mainly revolves around the need that states should be more expressive in their practices concerning cyber warfare as IHL is still in the budding phase. The need of the hour is that a new customary norm should emerge, but states need to put sincere efforts as in the horizontal hierarchy of sovereign states law-making power vests in states. The recent cyberattacks in the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine by the ’patriots’ once again brought the application of IHL to the limelight.
