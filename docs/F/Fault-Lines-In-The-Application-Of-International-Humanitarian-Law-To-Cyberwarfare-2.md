## 2. THE ONSET OF DEBATE ON NEXUS BETWEEN IHL CYBERWARFARE
To make the debate better understandable for the reader, the history of cyber armed conflict that diverted the attention of international humanitarian law experts is discussed. The very beginning of the twenty-first century marked the independence of Estonia from the Soviet Union, which had occupied the land since the Second World War. The Statue (bronze soldier) at the center of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, was removed by the Tallinn residents who took the statute to be the sign of being occupied by the Soviet Union for nearly half a century (McGuinness, 2017). This enraged the ethnic Russians living in Estonia, who started social media campaigns for riots. This marked the onset of attacks from worldwide on both government and private cyberinfrastructures of Estonia. The disruption so caused halted the normal functioning of the state for some ten days. Though it was an issue of law concerning the justification for the use of force (*jus ad bellum*) and not IHL, it was for the first time the world was witnessing the attacks in a domain not discussed before. In 2008 the debate on the application of IHL to cyberwarfare started following the

Russo-Georgian war, which is regarded as "the first case in the history of a coordinated cyberspace domain attack synchronized with major combat actions in the other warfighting domains" (David, 2011). These attacks were more disruptive than destructive (Swanson, 2010). These attacks have played a huge role in making analysts and scholars think of the nexus between IHL and attacks in the cyber domain (Tikk, 2010).

There have been certain international and national efforts to develop the rules governing the armed conflicts in cyberspace. The most significant being the Tallinn Manual compiled by the twenty individuals in the international group of experts (IGE) under the auspices of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and observership of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The Manual was intended to be based on existing law (lex lata), and nowhere was it intended to be referring to an altogether new law (*lex feranda*). For this reason, the rules in the Manual stayed closer to the rules of IHL, a lex specialis for regulating the conduct of hostilities during an armed conflict. However, the sovereign states have the prerogative of making binding rules for them either by a treaty formation or by the consistent and coherent state practices out of the sense of legal obligation developing a new customary norm. Manual has only the persuasive value for the States. Some states, including France, have come up with laws specifically on the subject matter beforehand, which is a positive sign in terms of expression of state practice.

Whenever some grey area in terms of war comes under discussion, the first provision that legal minds refer to is the Martens Clause that was initially the part of the preamble of Hague Convention II of 1899 and then incorporated as a substantial part in the Geneva law<sup>5</sup> and the Hague law<sup>6</sup> . The Martens clause extends the application of international law based on coherent and consistent usages, public conscience, and humanity to complex cases. The vitality of said clause is manifested from the fact that it is restated in modern conventions and has been referred to by international courts<sup>7</sup> and tribunals<sup>8</sup> , especially where they faced the instances of legal vacuum (non-liquet), and it has become part of customary international law<sup>9</sup> . The insertion of this clause primarily made IHL of an evolving nature capable of dealing with and adapting to the changing dynamics of warfare. IHL has undoubtedly filled in the potential legal gaps by the way it is drafted. Questions and debates as to the evolution of "interpretation" of IHL are the tasks of the states, courts, organizations tasked with disseminating IHL (primarily ICRC), and the researchers. As far as cyber warfare is concerned, the researchers and the non-state neutral entities have been positively playing their role, and now it is the states that need to step up by way of practice or by entering into an international agreement. The latter does not seem to be a viable solution as states do not seem to be willing to be vocal about the restrictions on their cyber capabilities, which is improving over time) (Turns, 2012).
