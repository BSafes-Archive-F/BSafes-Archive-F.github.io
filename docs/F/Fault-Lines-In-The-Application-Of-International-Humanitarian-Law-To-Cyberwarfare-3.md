## 3. THE FAULT LINES IN THE APPLICATION OF IHL TO CYBERWARFARE
### 3.1 Interpretation of the term attack in a cyber context
In the technical sense, cyber warfare refers to the weaponized use of digital tools employed for the system-to-system attack via a data stream. The cyber operations based on purpose can be classified into Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) and Computer Network Attack (CNA) (Beck, 2002). The former refers to data theft without the intent of damaging the functionality of the system compromised (access operations). The latter aims to generate targeted effects on the system, including data tampering by deleting or altering, disabling the function, or physical damage to the system (effect operations).

For a cyber operation to constitute a cyberattack for triggering the application of IHL, the determining factor is the reasonable expectation of death or injury to persons or destruction or damage to objects, notwithstanding whether such an operation was offensive or defensive <sup>10</sup>. The term attack at this point needs to be analyzed since it forms the basis of several general principles and special prohibitions in terms of the IHL. The prohibitions against indiscriminate attacks, attacks against civilians, attacks against civilian objects, an attack against medical personnel, attacks against the natural environment, attacks against dangerous forces, and so on beg the question of what is meant by "attack" in a cyber context. Article 49 (1) of Additional Protocol I defines attack in the following terms:

> “. . . acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offense or defense.”

So violence is the indicative factor for classifying which military operations could be called attacks irrespective of the domain in which such an attack is carried out. For this reason, psychological cyber operations do not fall within the meaning of attack for want of violence<sup>11</sup>. Now, these violent attacks should not be restrictively interpreted to mean only those violent acts that release kinetic forces. IHL has a consequential-based approach since every principle is centered on the central theme of protecting civilians from the "effects" of conflict to the possible extent. So it is the violent consequences, not the nature of acts, that determines the scope of the attack<sup>12</sup>. For instance, conventionally destroying the electric grid system supplying electricity to the whole city is equivalent in terms of consequences to the use of cyber operations for causing such destruction. Thus such cyber operation qualifies as an attack. As a matter of law, it has been agreed universally that biological and chemical attacks are in legal sense attacks despite no kinetic release and was discouraged in its employment as a means of warfare even before the specific convention was entered into <sup>13</sup>. Thus one can by analogy extend this principle to cyber warfare.

There is support from several provisions of Additional Protocol I and the customary rules to interpret the term violence. It is agreed among the majority of experts that

{: .fs-2}
<sup>11</sup> German Manual, para 474. 
{: .fs-2}
<sup>12</sup> In other words IHL is not worried about acts that are violent or involve the transfer of kinetic force what IHL cares about are the consequences.

<sup>13</sup> *In Prosecutor v Dusko Tadic* (Decision on the Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal, 1995) paras 120-124 the ICTY decided against the use of chemical weapons in either forms of armed conflict. Analogically the same is true for the cyberattacks.

***

the violence must not be de minis which will not qualify the operation as an attack. The indicative factors include the excessive death, destruction, or combination thereof, damage to the environment that is severe, widespread, and long-term <sup>14</sup>, severe losses arising from the destruction of critical infrastructure <sup>15</sup>. It is pertinent to mention here that the law forbids those attacks that can "foreseeably cause" the required extent of harm. So though the cyberattack might not have caused the required harm to the system directly targeted yet, such an attack has the potential of causing more significant harm to the person or objects, which would be prohibited had the attack been that of a conventional nature. So it will be absolute absurdity and irrationality if one arrives at a different conclusion merely because the warfare is conducted in a cyber domain. So, till here, what constitutes cyber operation has been discussed, which will be used in defining the term cyber warfare.

In its study on the limitations imposed by IHL on the cyberattacks, ICRC defined cyber warfare in the following terms:

“[Cyberwarfare refers to] means and methods of warfare that consist of cyber operations amounting to, or conducted in the context of, an armed conflict, within the meaning of IHL (ICRC, 2013).”

The above definition gives two possibilities. Firstly, if it meets the criteria of armed conflict, a cyber operation in itself can be cyber warfare. Secondly, if conducted in furtherance of an armed conflict, the cyber operation can be termed as cyberwarfare.

Moreover, not all the conflicts or attacks come within the purview of IHL but only the ‘armed conflicts. The terms “resort to armed force" and “armed conflict" is not expressly defined in the treaty IHL (Droege, 2012), so the resort has to be made to jurisprudence to discover the true meaning and apply it in the cyber context. Here is a trichotomy of approaches as to the cyber operation amounting to an armed attack and thereby triggering the application of IHL. These are the permissive approach, the restrictive approach, and the functional approach. The underlying idea of the permissive approach is that the cyber operations not causing the actual physical destruction are deemed permissible. This is an over-exclusive interpretation that, if applied to the potential situations, will defeat the very purpose and spirit of IHL. This approach opens gates for the mysteries that will not be resolved had the law been strictly interpreted even when the surrounding circumstances in which it is to be applied are evolving. The restrictive approach is based on the principle of distinction that the military objectives could only be targeted, and any attack against a civilian object is unlawful. But in the cyber domain, does this principle implies that all the operations against civilians are unlawful? Which will be analyzed later. The approach adopted by the majority in the Tallinn manual is called the *functionality* approach, whereby damage includes an operation that, albeit not physically damaging or destructive, affects the functionality of the cyberinfrastructure against which it is directed. The determining factor here is whether the infrastructure attacked is prevented from performing its intended function. If yes, then civilian objects will enjoy the protection of IHL against the damage arising therefrom. Though this seems to be a sensible approach, the dispute arises whether the functioning shall be permanently disrupted to call such an operation an attack or even the temporary disruption would cause the operation to fall within the meaning of attack under IHL.

The disabling of the object in a cyber operation (the functionality approach) finds support in Article 52 of AP I when it talks about the “neutralization" of objects. If one adopts the functionality approach, the only cyber incident that would fulfill an attack requirement was the “Operation Olympic Games.” The nuclear enrichment facilities were targeted, especially the centrifugal apparatus installed for the purification of Uranium in the nuclear facility of Natanz, Iran. Cyber analysts named the bug developed by the coalition of the U.S. and Israel as Stuxnet. From 1000 to 5000 centrifuge machines broke down, and it was programmed to remain unnoticed even by the cyber security measures taken in the Natanz nuclear facility. So this cyber operation affected the functionality of the devices targeted, and thus this fulfills the functionality approach of attack. ICRC views the disability of an object as the sole criterion for defining the term attack irrespective of whether it is brought by cyber means or kinetic means, and the writer also thinks it to be the most suitable approach in pragmatic terms (ICRC, 2013). The way the attacks should be interpreted and how such an approach could be refined depends on the relevant State practices.

### 3.2 Interpreting the term object in cyber context: Is data an object or not?

Another important area of dispute amongst legal experts is whether data can be called an object for attack? Since the very thing against which a cyber attack is conducted is data. If it is called an object and a civilian object, then it will enjoy the protection afforded by IHL to civilian objects, and hacking would be a war crime. Even in the commentary of the Tallinn Manual, it is expressed that the views of the IGE were divided. The majority view was that data could not be interpreted as an object. They based their view on the ICRC’s commentary on article 52 of Additional Protocol I, which states that an object is something that is “visible" and "tangible." Since data is virtual thus, it does not come within the ordinary meaning of the term object.

Furthermore, they argued that no expressed state practice suggests that data is protected as an object. This interpretation implies that "any" cyber operation against civilian data will not be an attack against a civilian object if the functionality of the infrastructure attacked remains intact. Minorities believe that data is an object and that any cyber operation against civilian data is an attack on a civilian object and is thus prohibited by IHL. They argue that the interpretation should be influenced by the surrounding and evolving circumstances. The expert calls the former interpretation to be under-inclusive and the latter interpretation to be over-inclusive. Here the reference to the balancing approach adopted by IHL is relevant. IHL is a body of law that seeks to balance military necessity and humanitarian consideration. Those who interpret data as not an object overemphasize the military necessity. At the same time, the other group interpreting data as an object overemphasizes the humanitarian considerations. So in the true spirit and purposes of IHL, both these views are not correct. Again States have the authority of interpreting it, and the States would be more inclined towards interpreting data as not an object because they will want to attack the data during counterinsurgencies to deprive the military of the support of the civilian population. Still, data is to be protected based on the functionality test that the data cannot be manipulated where it will affect the intended use of the infrastructure containing such data.

ICRC’s position on this issue is that the data that enjoy special protection under IHL have a comprehensive normative framework (ICRC, 2015). For instance, medical data is protected because it is "medical" data, not because it is an object, and IHL provides special protection to the purpose such data serves. This is especially relevant in the current backdrop of the pandemic situation. The same is valid for protecting the humanitarian assistance data not because it is an object but because of its function, which enjoys special protection in IHL. The concern is about that data which is essentially civilian data but does not enjoy special protection under IHL. The general rules regulating the conduct of hostilities cover the protection of such data like tax records, bank accounts, company data, and election records. If such data is tampered with or deleted, it can halt the functioning of governmental organizations and private businesses. It might have the potential of causing harm to civilians greater than that resulting from the destruction of physical objects. Reconciliation with the underlying purpose (raison detre) of IHL is impossible if one concludes that in today’s cyber-reliant world, the operation against civilian data is not an attack against a civilian ‘object’ (ICRC, 2016).

### 3.3 Difficulty of Attribution in Cyber Context: Classification of Armed Conflict in Cyberspace
Suppose a person within the territory of Japan, at the request of the U.S. government, compromised the functionality of all the electricity grid stations in Iran, which is engaged in an armed conflict with France, a staunch ally of the U.S. This resulted in a complete electricity blackout in Iran for seven hours which halted the smooth functioning of all the sectors of the country with special reference to health care facilities and critical civilian infrastructure. The attacker is amongst the top cyber experts in the world, and thus, the attack is likely to have been conducted without leaving behind any clue as to the true origin of the attack. This illustration manifests, amongst others, one of the biggest concerns for IHL application to the armed conflicts in the cyber domain, i.e., the issue of attribution (i.e., identifying the source of the attack and “who did it? Rather more precisely “who is to blame") for three main reasons. Firstly, in an ongoing armed conflict, IHL regulates only those cyber operations which have a causal link with the ongoing armed conflict. Establishing that link and determining whether it was conducted in furtherance of an armed conflict attribution is indispensable. Secondly, IHL has a distinct set of rules applicable to International Armed Conflicts (IACs), when two or more states resort to the use of force and Non-International Armed Conflicts (NIACs) essentially involve at least one non-state organized armed group. The concepts of foreign intervention and NIAC spillover are linked to it, which the state practices and judicial decisions have settled down. Until the attacker is not identified, the lack of attribution would make the classification of armed conflict impossible, and in turn, the applicable law would be doubtful. Thirdly, the accountability for the attack is based on attribution and identification of the attacker. 

Two famous tests govern the attribution based on state control: the effective control test and the overall control test. The former test propounded by ICJ in the Nicaragua case <sup>16</sup> considers a state responsible for the acts of non-state actors only when each of the acts during the conflict were carried out in furtherance of State-specific instructions. This legal regime was applied to the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, where the threshold of

effective control of Russia over alleged perpetrators was not met. The digital forensic evidence substantiated the coordination of cyber-attacks with the ongoing armed conflict in a physical domain which convincingly indicated the involvement of the Kremlin (Russian government). However, Russia called the attacker Russian patriots on whom the government lacked overall control. This leads to the claim that the "attribution fixation of the effective control test is a de facto license for impunity in the cybersphere" (Healey, 2012).

Hence owing to the difficulty in standards of proof, the much-celebrated test in judicial decisions is the less stringent overall control test laid down by ICTY<sup>17</sup>. In the given backdrop of limitations of cyber attribution, the overall control test is more compatible as it entails the responsibility onto the states having a role in organizing, planning, and coordinating the non-state groups besides mere financial and logistical support<sup>18</sup>. If this test were applied to the Russo-Georgian war, there would have been a *prima facie* case of Russian responsibility as the available strategic and forensic evidence pointed towards the Russian influence over the “cyber patriots" (Assumpcao, 2020).

These attributions are irrespective of the domain in which they are carried out. However, identifying the perpetrator of the attack is essential for determining the issue of state attribution (referring to the example of the Iranian attack given at the start of the discussion) and determining whether the conflict is IAC or NIAC. Cyber warfare’s ease in denial of responsibility is likely to appeal to states in using it for attacking purposes in the future. At times in this paper, the rules applicable to biological, nuclear, and chemical warfare (which are also the new means and methods of warfare) have been by way of analogy extended to warfare in the cyber domain. Nevertheless, biological and chemical warfare attribution is not an issue since the state exercises monopoly and control over its nuclear and chemical facilities. The cyber domain bestows upon attackers the possibility of hiding their identities and carrying out attacks without the fear of being identified by defenders. Even the attacker can program the malware in such a way as to falsify his identity and to shift responsibility, in the event defender can locate the attacker, onto someone who was not even aware of it (false attribution). So anonymity issue is yet to be resolved, and such a breakthrough is not likely to happen in the near future (Jastram, 2011). Currently, threefold assumptions dominate the virtual or cyber attribution issue (Rid, 2015). The first assumption is the least optimistic one and thinks internet redesign to be the only way out for the most intractable issue (Singer, 2014) of cyber attribution (McConnell, 2020). Most of the legal debate is posited on this assumption (Waxman, 2011) (Tsagourias, 2013) (Roscini, 2014). The second assumption is an intermediary approach and views that depending on the case, the issue of attribution could be solved by discovering the culprit, or it remains unsolved and leads merely to obfuscated log files, spoofed I.P. addresses, or any other dead trail (Healey, 2013). The third assumption is highly optimistic because the attributive evidence is readily comprehensible, and the only obstacle is finding out the evidence for which proponents have presented models<sup>19</sup>. The determinative factors in practical terms include

findings of digital forensics (technical investigation) and strategic investigation based on intelligence information, history, and the knowledge of possible attackers on assessment of incentive involved (cost-benefit analysis) (Lin, 2012). This could help in tracing the attacker for taking further action.

The non-international armed conflict (NIAC) is “protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State."<sup>20</sup> The two requisites, keeping in view the definition provided in common article 3 to all G.C.’s and article 1 of AP II, for a conflict to be NIAC are organized armed groups and required level of intensity. The threshold for a NIAC is higher than for IAC as the mere riots or sporadic acts of violence are excluded from the scope of NIAC. In *Prosecutor v Limaj* the ICTY adopted a lenient approach and deemed the presence of ‘some’ level of organization sufficient for proving the first requisite<sup>21</sup>. This requirement requires a case-by-case analysis, but some of the indicative factors ICTY looked into in the Limaj case were: formal hierarchy, order from the superior, the establishment of headquarters, disciplinary rules, and recruits. Thus, those cyber-attacks conducted by an individual *sua sponte* are not an armed conflict of either category. Another implication is that merely the occurrences of cyber-attacks in parallel may be called collective but are not organized (such as Estonian attacks). There is a possibility that the individuals tasked with specific responsibilities like looking for vulnerabilities, programing and designing malware, launching it, and taking defenses against counterattacks arrange in hierarchically organized form with one assuming the virtual responsible command.

Moreover, it is acknowledged that such an organization is not necessarily required to be as sophisticated as is in regular armed forces; nevertheless, there should be some organization<sup>22</sup>. The lack of interaction in the physical world cast doubts about the organization of the cyber armed group. This also raises the problem of maintaining discipline as the command control, if any, is merely online. Moreover, the AP II has put in place an additional requirement of the ability to comply with the rules of IHL, which though is not the requirement under common article 3 to all four Geneva Conventions yet it is considered as a ‘convenient criteria’<sup>23</sup> and was applied by ICTY<sup>24</sup> in classifying the conflict. If compliance is necessary for classifying the conflict as a NIAC, then possibly all virtual attacks/ operations will be outside the definition of NIAC for want of effective means for ensuring compliance<sup>25</sup> .

The second criteria for a NIAC to be the protracted armed conflict lack any bright-line test, yet certain factors support in determin

ing it, like the intensity of the armed conflict to distinguish it from mere internal disturbances. The high threshold might exclude several cyber operations from the definition of NIAC.

States are yet to classify the cyber conflicts, not in furtherance of an ongoing armed conflict. However, it will undoubtedly pose serious complex issues in the future. The writer can see the customary norm evolving in the near future as the dependency on cyberinfrastructure increases with time and the states have been developing more disruptive cyber-attack tools. States, therefore, will act in a particular way out of the sense of legal obligation (*opinio juris*) to tackle the legal problems incidental to such attacks. IHL in the cyber context is in the budding phase and will develop with time.
