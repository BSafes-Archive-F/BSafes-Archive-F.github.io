## 4. CONCLUSION
> *“If the new and frightful weapons of destruction which are now at the disposal of the nations seem destined to abridge the duration of future wars, it appears likely, on the other hand, that future battles will only become more and more murderous.”*

> Henry Dunant, A Memory of Solferino, 1862

The present study attempted to highlight the basic debates fundamental to IHL in cyber warfare. This is a vast topic, but the scope was limited to the discussions on the interpretation of general terms. The paper has clarified that these debates will continue until some viable solution is adopted. The dilemma is that the IHL developed in the times of conventional warfare when the cyberattack was but fiction. The only way out is either a new convention specifically devoted to cyber-armed conflicts or the consistent state practices out of a sense of legal obligation that will develop binding customs on the subject matter. Even though states are reluctant in making a norm or entering into treaty relations, potentially curtailing their use of cyber weapons, Tallinn Manual is a hope for the future of IHL in cyberwarfare.

Moreover, states will indulge more and more in devastating cyber conflicts (as is the case with autonomous weapons) as they are involved in the cyber arms race. This will probably lead to the emergence of a new norm, but that emergence is nowhere in the immediate future (maybe it would take decades). The attacking states will be more likely to interpret the provisions of the existing law of armed conflict to act as a scapegoat from any responsibility. For instance, interpreting data not as an object as they are and will like to continue attacks against civilian data. Unlike the convention on chemical and biological weapons, cyber weapon treaties, though best serves the problem, should be forgotten in the given backdrop of enhanced military reliance. The need for treaty-making for a new form of warfare was felt in the aftermath of World War II (the new domain at that time was airspace), in the words of J. M. Spaight: “It now remains to show why it is better to proceed by creating a new and special code . . . rather than by building upon and adding to the rules already governing land warfare" (Spaight, 1924). The author guesses that once the state practice has fully developed, only then would the treatymaking be possible, which will be nothing but the expression of those norms developed. However, before any such development, the rules of IHL should continue to govern the cyberwarfare and be interpreted in the light of the values on which IHL is premised.
