## INTRODUCTION
The use of monetary incentives to induce people to behave in salubrious ways abounds, though it is as controversial as it is ubiquitous (Brown, 2017). Few will have been surprised at offers of money since 2021 to increase rates of vaccination against COVID-19. The Canadian province of Alberta and various U.S. states offered entry to state lotteries with million-dollar prizes to those who had hitherto been slow to embrace vaccines. In the summer of 2021, Greece started to offer younger members of the adult population 150 Euros for vaccination (Sullivan, 2021), and in November of the same year, the Ukrainian government gave payments of 1,000 hryvnias (35 Euros) per person to increase its rate of vaccination, one of Europe's lowest at 15% when the incentive was introduced. <sup>1</sup> Given that one-third of survey respondents in the U.S. express greater willingness to be vaccinated in return for a modest payment, this seems to be money well spent. Evidence on the effectiveness of monetary incentives in healthcare, especially in the long term, is, however, ambiguous (Brown, 2017, 141), but even if the evidence bespoke the lasting efficacy of monetary incentives, some commentators question whether efficacy be the only criterion for judging these incentives. One such criticism is levelled by Michael Sandel who discusses monetary incentives generally, but pays particular attention to their use in inducing drug addicts to agree to sterilization. Critics of monetary incentives have levelled the charge of “bribery” against monetary payment in healthcare though the charge is often made with little analysis. Sandel explores the bribery analogy in detail, and his work is worthy of scrutiny for that reason. Sandel holds that monetary incentives involve “corruption”, a concept which, along with “coercion”, is central to his critique of commodification in contemporary social life. He first makes this argument about payments to drug addicts who, in return for money, agree to be sterilized; he proceeds to address the more general use of money to prompt members of the public to take better care of their health.

This essay unfolds as follows. Section One explores cash for sterilization and Sandel's analysis thereof. Sandel proposes a judicial analogy with which he justifies the term “bribery” to describe monetary payments made to addicts in return for their consent to be sterilized. If the analogy is to hold, Sandel would have to show that a drug addict who consents to sterilization in exchange for money acts illicitly. As I detail in Section Two, Sandel offers two criteria according to which being sterilized for money might be illicit: that the transaction (i) serves an “external end” and (ii) is against the interest of addicts. With regard to the latter criterion, one would expect Sandel to state wherein addicts' interest lies, but he disappoints this expectation. In Section Three, I undertake an analysis of the reasons for which addicts might agree to be sterilized in order to ascertain which reasons for sterilization may be deemed to thwart addicts' interest. The analysis is continued empirically in Section Four by examining evidence on both abortion and sterilization to ascertain how much light such evidence can throw onto cash for sterilization. The evidence suggests that cash for sterilization is most problematic when the offer of money compromises the autonomy of those contemplating sterilization. This applies to drug addicts whose circumstances – addiction and often poverty – may be deemed to cajole them into agreeing to be sterilized and thus compromise the voluntary nature of their consent. This argument aligns with Sandel's coercion criticism of commodification rather than with his corruption objection. I conclude that the latter objection is insufficiently developed to form an effective critique of monetary incentives in healthcare. Sandel's critique of cash for sterilization derives its power from the notion of coercion, not from corruption.

Non-monetary rewards have also been offered, for instance, in some U.S. states which have given out free shot guns, beer and marijuana; chickens have been given in return for vaccination in Indonesia, while some Chinese provinces offer eggs (Lewis, 2021; Qin and Chien, 2021; Sullivan, 2021). Private corporations also offer financial rewards to employees who elect to be vaccinated (https://www.dw.com/en/german-retailer-offers-bonus-to-vaccinated-workers/a-57217050)
