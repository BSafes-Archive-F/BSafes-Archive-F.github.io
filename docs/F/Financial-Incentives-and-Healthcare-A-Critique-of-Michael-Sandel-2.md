## COERCION, CORRUPTION, AND STERILIZATION
Project Prevention, a U.S.-based non-profit organization, has pioneered an approach to unintended pregnancies involving drug-addicted people. The organization proposes a transaction between itself and its clients – drug-addicted or alcoholic men and women (henceforth “addicts”) – which consists in a payment from the organization in return for addicts' consent to long-term contraception or sterilization. Discussions of this arrangement have focused on female addicts, particularly those who are sterilized in exchange for $300. This focus reflects the small number of male clients whom the organization has persuaded to have a vasectomy (401 to May, 2021) compared to the number of women who have made up the majority of the organization's clients to date (7695). Of these female clients, 2444 have been sterilized (tubal ligation); the modal form of birth control is the reversible IUD implant administered to nearly 3000 women. <sup>2</sup>

Sandel (45)<sup>3</sup> rehearses the utilitarian justification of this transaction, according to which, if both parties are rational and enter into the transaction voluntarily, both may be assumed to gain: the addict $300 and Project Prevention the guarantee that the addict will not procreate; social welfare therefore increases and so the transaction is ethically edifying on utilitarian grounds. An objection to this argument rests on the notion of coercion: can an addict, possibly someone who lives in straitened financial circumstances, resist the offer of $300? If not, the choice to be sterilized is not a truly voluntary one, for the addict is coerced by her circumstances into accepting the offer (45). I return to the coercion objection to cash for sterilization in Section Four but, in what follows, I attend to a different criticism of Project Prevention based on the notion of corruption. This criticism, Sandel (1998, 95-96) argues, is conceptually independent of the coercion objection, for it is based on a different “moral ideal”. The transaction between Project Prevention and an addict is corrupt, “a form of bribery” (46). The bribery allegation has been made by others, both with respect to Project Prevention (Chelian, 2003-4, 194-195), to other uses of monetary incentives promoting birth control (Sunil et al., 1999, 564) and to the use of financial incentives to further salubrious behaviour unrelated to contraception (Ashcroft, 2011). Sandel uses the term bribery in analogy with a judge who is bribed into issuing a crooked verdict. The judge effectively “sells” the verdict and thereby uses his office as an instrument for personal gain, not as a “public trust”; consequently the judge “degrades and demeans his office by treating it according to a lower norm than is appropriate to it” (46). The latter phrase encapsulates Sandel's “broader definition” of corruption. By analogy, addicts who transact with Project Prevention sell something which should not be sold – their reproductive capacity. They thereby treat this capacity inappropriately – not as a “gift or trust to be exercised according to norms of responsibility and care”, but as a tool for monetary gain (46-47).

Because the concept of bribery is central to this essay, I offer a definition of bribery on the basis of which my critical analysis of Sandel follows.

1. ) A bribe is a sum of money offered by person B who has the intention of prompting person A, to whom the money is offered, to perform an action, α. (Although a bribe may be non-monetary, I will assume that it is monetary). 

1. ) B assumes thereby that, but for the bribe, A would not perform action α. (If B assumed that A would perform α irrespective of the bribe, the bribe would be otiose; if A performs α because of the bribe, one may say that the bribe motivates A to perform α). 

1. ) Action α is illicit.

All three conditions are fulfilled in the case of the corrupt judge. If Sandel's analogy is to work, they must also apply to the case of cash for sterilization. Is this so?

Project Prevention offers money to addicts with the intention of convincing them to be sterilized; this is the stated purpose of the organization, and so point 1) of the definition is fulfilled. The organization assumes thereby that, in the absence of payment, the addicts would not agree to be sterilized. It is, furthermore,

There is an irony about the female focus in commentaries on Project Prevention, for the earliest monetary incentives for birth control were offered to men willing to have a vasectomy in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu in 1956 (Sunil et al., 1999: 563).

plausible to assume that many of the organization's clients who have undergone some form of birth control would not have done so had it not been for Project Prevention's offer. Consequently, point 2) of our definition of bribery is fulfilled. Before we explore whether cash for sterilization fulfils point 3), we must clarify it by returning to the judge.

In the judge's case, action α (delivering a false verdict) is illicit independent of the bribe. Accepting a bribe is but one reason for delivering a false verdict, and there are other reasons which might motivate a judge to do so, e.g., personal animus or racial bias. Being motivated by such factors makes the judgement illicit without a monetary bribe. In fact, it is hard to imagine a reason that would justify the the wilful pronouncement of a crooked verdict; delivering such a verdict is inherently wrong. Is the case of cash for sterilization similar? That is, are there no conceivable reasons which would justify a drug addict's decision to be sterilized? If not, then, like the judge's issuing of a crooked verdict, action α (the addict's consenting to being sterilized) would be illicit regardless whether the addict was offered money, and the analogy with the judge would hold. However, to contend that it is never justified that a drug addict be sterilized is an extreme position. Although Sandel does not expostulate explicitly on the matter, this extreme position is not one which we can ascribe to him.

Sandel addresses this point obliquely through an argument which he puts into the mouth of an imaginary interlocutor who states: “Money aside, the woman does no wrong if she chooses to be sterilized” (47). The interlocutor clearly believes that there are justifiable reasons for being sterilized, although these reasons are not specified. From the fact that there are justifiable reasons for sterilization, Sandel's interlocutor infers that, since a woman has “a right to give up her childbearing capacity for reasons of her own, … she must also have the right to do so for a price” (47). Sandel's reply to his interlocutor is non-committal: he merely notes that “we have to figure out what norms should govern our sexual and procreative lives” in order to ascertain whether market relations belong there (47); he therefore takes no explicit stance on the matter. With that, Sandel interrupts his discussion of cash for sterilization. Hence, it remains unclear whether Sandel agrees with his interlocutor that there are reasons which justify the addict's decision to be sterilized and, if so, what these reasons are. Consequently, the closeness of the analogy between the judge and the addict remains unspecified. Is an addict's decision to be sterilized in exchange for money ever justified? A negative answer, as I have just noted, would be an extreme, uncompromising view. An affirmative answer, by contrast, would mean that being sterilized in return for money is not always wrong, and this would constitute a difference between an addict and a judge whose delivery of a crooked verdict is always wrong. If Sandel supported an affirmative answer to the question, one would expect him to differentiate the conditions under which consenting to sterilization is licit from those under which it is illicit. His main discussion of cash for sterilization offers no such differentiation, though he returns to cash for sterilization in his more general discussion of “health bribes” to which we attend in the following section.
