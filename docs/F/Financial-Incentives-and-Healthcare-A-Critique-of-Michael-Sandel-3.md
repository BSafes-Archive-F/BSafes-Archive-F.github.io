## ENDS AND REASONS – INTRINSIC AND EXTERNAL
Sandel offers a general discussion of monetary incentives in healthcare, e.g., to encourage people to give up smoking or lose weight. In what follows, I use the example of losing weight to illustrate his criticism of health bribes and then ask in which ways it differs from his criticism of cash for sterilization.

A person who takes steps to lose weight in return for money acts in a way which serves an external end. As an example of an external, Sandel mentions “reducing health costs for companies or a national health service” (58). He contrasts these ends which losing weight promotes with the reasons for which people might choose to lose weight. What, according to Sandel, makes financial payments for losing weight questionable, is that the recipient of the payment loses weight for an external reason, namely, the prospect of acquiring money. Note that the category of external reason is independent of the category of external end. The external reason of wanting to acquire money is the “wrong” reason for losing weight; it supplants a “better”, intrinsic, reason. This intrinsic reason issues, not from a desire to acquire money, but from a proper attitude of care and respect for one's body. Money, however, “tricks” a person into losing weight, and though losing weight is in the person's interest, because it improves his health, the manipulation involved in offering people money is what makes this practice bribery (59). Let us compare this account of health bribes in general with Sandel's account of cash for sterilization.

Like health bribes generally, cash for sterilization serves an external end. When addicts undergo sterilization, the monetary incentive prompts them “to relinquish their reproductive capacity not for their own good but for the sake of an external end—preventing more drug-addicted babies” (58). Health bribes differ from cash for sterilization, however, when it comes to the interest of the person to whom a payment is offered: whereas a payment to lose weight prompts an overweight person to act in his own interest, addicts who accept cash for sterilization “are being paid to act, in many cases at least, against their interest” (58 emphasis added). This, Sandel holds, makes the use of the term “bribery” all the more compelling with regard to sterilization, though in the context of health bribes, he argues, the term “bribery” is apposite on account of the “trick” involved in motivating people to lose weight for the wrong reason, viz., acquiring money. One might contend, pace Sandel, that the term “bribery”, to describe the case of paying people to lose weight, is misplaced, for it differs decisively from the case of the corrupt judge: the person who loses weight when paid to do so is, according to Sandel, doing the right thing for the wrong reason; the judge, by contrast, who, acting on a bribe, finds an innocent person guilty, is not doing the right thing for the wrong reason but is doing something intrinsically wrong. This would seem to vitiate any analogy between judicial corruption and paying people to stay healthy, though Sandel uses the term “bribery” to describe both.

Returning to the case of sterilization, Sandel does not explicitly address the reasons addicts have for being sterilized; indeed, in contrast to his discussion of health bribes, one finds no distinction between external and intrinsic reasons in his discussion of sterilization. But rather than assume that reasons are irrelevant to Sandel's analysis of the latter, one may reconstruct his approach in a manner which accords a role to the reasons for which addicts agree to sterilization. Indeed, it is imperative to investigate the reasons addicts have for being sterilized if we are to assess Sandel's claim that being sterilized in exchange for money is against their interests.

By offering money to addicts, Sandel holds, Project Prevention “tricks” them into being sterilized, and the addicts thereby become instruments who act in a way which serves an external end, namely, to prevent the birth of drug-addicted babies. What makes this end external? One indication of its externality is to consider how addicts would answer the following question: Why are you agreeing to the offer made by Project Prevention? Sandel seems to presume that addicts would reply: “In order to get some cash” and not: “In order to reduce the number of drug-addicted babies”. If this is Sandel's presumption, the goal of preventing the birth of drug-addicted babies which the sterilization of addicts certainly serves would answer to the name of an external end from the perspectives of addicts, for it does not play a part in motivating them to agree to sterilization. <sup>4</sup> From the perspective of Project Prevention, by contrast, reducing the number of drug-addicted babies constitutes a reason for sterilizing addicts. What motivates addicts to agree to the terms of the transaction is the prospect of earning money which, in turn, allows them to acquire drugs. This, at least, is the position I ascribe to Sandel, for although he does not refer to addicts' reasons for being sterilized, this is the most charitable way of rendering his position, and it corresponds to the way in which he himself analyses health bribes.

Addicts, if we pursue this reconstruction of Sandel's position, agree to be sterilized for the wrong (external) reason, namely, the prospect of acquiring money. Like recipients of health bribes for losing weight, addicts are manipulated into being sterilized by the offer of money. But Sandel notes a difference between recipients of health bribes and the drug-addicted clients of Project Prevention: whereas the former are tricked into doing something which accords with the own interest, addicts do not, “in many cases at least”, act in their own interest when they agree to be sterilized (58). The phrase quoted raises the following question: which criterion separates the “many cases” in which addicts act against, from those in which they act in, their own interest? This is something we will explore in the following section when we consider reasons for sterilization. Sandel also leaves a further question unanswered: what would he counsel addicts to do? In the case of health

bribes, one may infer his answer to the question: “What is to be done?”, namely: overweight people should lose weight, but they should do so, not because a healthcare provider proffers them money for doing so, but because they have cultivated an attitude of care and respect for their body. But what should addicts do – what are good (intrinsic) reasons for being sterilized if money constitutes a bad reason? Or should addicts refrain from being sterilized and do something else instead?These are questions which Sandel leaves unanswered.
