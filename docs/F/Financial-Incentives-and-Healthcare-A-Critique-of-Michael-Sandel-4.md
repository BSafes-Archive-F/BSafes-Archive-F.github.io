## REASONS FOR STERILIZATION
Project Prevention aims to reduce births of drug-addicted babies and pays addicts to be sterilized in order to reach this end. In the previous section I argued that the end of preventing the birth of drug-addicted babies was external to the concerns of addicts in the sense that reaching this end is not what motivates them to agree to being sterilized. This suggests a dissonance between the ends the organization pursues and those pursued by addicts when they agree to be sterilized. It also strengthens Sandel's view that addicts are tricked into this transaction: in return for money, addicts aid Project Prevention in the pursuit of an end which the organization deems worthy of pursuit (preventing the birth of addicted babies), though the addicts' interest is not served by this transaction.

If, however, one takes Project Prevention at its word, decreasing births of addicted babies is a necessary consequence of its program, but it is not an end in itself. This can be inferred from the fact that Project Prevention mentions other ends which it pursues. If we examine these other ends, we can ascertain whether there is greater congruence between ends pursued by the Project Prevention and ends pursued by addicts. We can descry whether any of these ends might provide good (“intrinsic”) reasons for addicts' choice to be sterilized and whether being sterilized for such reasons redounds to the interest of addicts. If so, it would cast the relationship between Project Prevention and its clients in a different light.

One goal after which Project Prevention strives is to reduce the amount of taxpayers' money spent on foster care and alleviating the caseload of social workers. These costs, the organization avers, might exceed $300,000 per child during the latter's lifetime. <sup>5</sup> The ends of reducing taxpayers' money and the burden on social workers are presumably external to the concerns of addicts who, we have been presuming, are more likely motivated by the receipt of $300. And this is apparently how Project Prevention conceives addicts' motivation, as revealed in an advertisement which states: “Don't let a pregnancy ruin your drug habit” (Chelian, 2003-4, 189-190). A not uncharitable interpretation of this slogan suggests that addicts should agree to sterilization in order to earn $300 which, in turn, will allow them to acquire the narcotic to which they are addicted. Furthermore, one may contend that acquiring money in order to further their consumption of drugs is not in the interest of addicts who accede to sterilization. This might explain the cynicism which Project Prevention's methods meet in the eyes of the organization's critics. But before we dismiss the motives behind Project Prevention as purely manipulative, let us consider further ends which the organization purports to pursue and ask whether they might constitute reasons of a less external nature to the concerns of addicts who contemplate sterilization.

An end which Project Prevention mentions is to spare as yet unborn children of the suffering which follows from both abuse and neglect at the hands of their parents and of fetal alcohol disorders which result in conditions deleterious to a child's life (see Chasnoff, 1988). The end of preventing children's suffering might play a role in addicts' deliberation about whether to be sterilized. If it does, this end should not be described as “external” to addicts' concerns. Moreover, an addict whose decision to be sterilized were swayed by concerns for the future child's health and welfare, would arguably be using her reproductive system according to the ethic of care and responsibility which Sandel admonishes us to exercise towards our reproductive capacities (47). This ethic of care would be exercised toward possible future children of the addict. Being sterilized out of concern for the fate of one's future children arguably qualifies as an “intrinsic” reason for sterilization, though it is unclear whether an addict would be acting in her own interest rather than in that of the unborn child if she

agrees to be sterilized in order to avoid harm to the child. Indeed, if she divests herself of the ability to have children at a future time, when, perhaps, she is no longer drug dependent, an addict who is sterilized on account of concerns for children born to her whilst she is addicted might be held to be sacrificing her own interest in having future progeny. This might be described as an other-regarding reason to be sterilized, and it would appear to be a responsible thing to do.

A further goal for which Project Prevention strives is to “alleviate from our clients the burden of having children that will potentially be taken away”. <sup>6</sup> Given the organization's emphasis on financial savings, one may suppose that concern for addicts is not foremost in the minds of the organization's personnel, but one may concede that giving birth to a child who is forcibly separated from its mother and taken into foster care causes immense emotional pain to the mother. If this consideration plays a role in an addict's decision be sterilized, there is a prima facie case for arguing that being sterilized expresses an attitude of responsibility and care toward oneself on the part of the addict; she would be assessing the consequences of giving birth and the future pain which might accrue to her if her child be made a ward of the state. There is, furthermore, a case for arguing that being sterilized, because it saves the addict from potential emotional pain, is her interest.

The foregoing discussion suggests that cash for sterilization serves more than the immediate end of reducing the birth of drug-addicted babies. Once other ends are acknowledged, it is arguable that addicts who agree to sterilization are (a) using their reproductive system in line with an ethic of care and responsibility and (b) acting in a way which furthers rather than thwarts their interest. One might, at this point, declare a stalemate in the debate between Sandel and proponents of Project Prevention, with both sides speculating about the reasons for addicts agreeing to be sterilized. If, as Sandel holds, most addicts are motivated by the prospect of acquiring money which they use to further their drug consumption, one may build a case for saying that sterilization is against the interests of addicts. If Project Prevention is right about other ends which the transaction between itself and its clients serve and if serving such ends plays a role in the deliberation of addicts who contemplate being sterilized, the case for arguing that sterilization is against addicts' interests is less strong. Only empirical investigation into addicts' reasoning will be able to determine which side has the stronger argument. Alas, survey research on addicts and their reasons for being sterilized is scarce. Nevertheless, evidence which relates to the matter is not entirely lacking, and I will consider it in the section which follows.
