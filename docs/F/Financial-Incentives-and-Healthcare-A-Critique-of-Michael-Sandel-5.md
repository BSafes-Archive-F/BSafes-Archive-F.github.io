## EVIDENCE
If there is a lack of evidence pertaining directly to addicts' reasons for sterilization, might other evidence shed light on the issue at hand? There is abundant evidence on women's reasons for abortion and for sterilization, and though it pertains largely to non-addicted populations, one may cautiously draw inferences from this evidence with the following caveats. First, abortion is not the same as sterilization. In some societies, the former is more morally charged, and this might be a cause for hesitation to abort which is lacking with regard to sterilization. Reasons for abortion might therefore differ from those lying behind sterilization. Nevertheless, both sterilization and abortion are types of birth control to which some considerations are common. Second, in jurisdictions with strict legal provisions on abortion or a vibrant anti-abortion lobby, access to abortion can be hindered by a lack of clinics performing legal abortions (where abortion is legal) and the requirement that a woman receive counselling prior to abortion (Gerdts et al., 2016; Joyce et al., 2009; Keefe-Oates et al., 2020). These obstacles are more often absent in the context of sterilization, although access to sterilization is far from open or equally distributed (Borrero et al., 2012; Zite et al., 2006), and in some societies, remaining childless carries social disapprobation; couples which do not procreate can be frowned upon, whereby it is often the woman who receives blame for the childless state of a heterosexual union (cf. Riessman, 2000). Attention to cultural and legal context is therefore important when one compares reasons given for abortion with those for sterilization. Third, abortion, unlike sterilization, does not divest a woman of the capacity to produce progeny in the future, and the decision whether to abort is likely to focus on shorter-term

considerations rather than the long-term implications which women who contemplate sterilization take into account. Fourth, when considering the evidence presented below, both that on abortion and on sterilization, we must hold in mind that it comes from the experience of women rather than of addicted women. Some studies, however, include drug-related reasons for abortion or sterilization, and these are relevant to the concerns of the drug-addicted clients of Project Prevention.
