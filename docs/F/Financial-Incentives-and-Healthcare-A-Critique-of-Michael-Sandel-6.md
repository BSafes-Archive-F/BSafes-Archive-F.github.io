## *Abortion*
Women's reasons for contemplating or having an abortion are many in number and varied in content (Finer *et al*., 2005, 117; Kirkman *et al*., 2010, 150). Prevalent amongst them are worries that the rearing of a child will have unwanted effects on the woman's life. Financial issues loom large, but so do worries that a child will upset a woman's career or educational aspirations (a reason cited more often by younger, childless and unmarried women) or that a child might disturb the existing life of a woman in other ways (Broen *et al*., 2005; Finer *et al*., 2005). These reasons might be described as “self-interested” because they concern the mother's assessment of her own interests in light of the prospect of becoming a mother. Other reasons, by contrast, are other-regarding. These include considerations of the possible negative impact of a new child on one's extant children or on one's relationship with one's intimate partner (Finer *et al.,* 2005, 117; Kirkman *et al.*, 2009, 374-375). A further other-regarding reason pertains to the well-being of the child. These well-being-related reasons include the concern that the child, were it born, would not be wanted or loved (Kirkman* et al*., 2009, 374). Intimate partner violence may also be included here, and there is a strong correlation between such violence and the desire for abortion (Taft et al., 2019). Solicitude about the future child's physical health is also weighed by women as a reason to terminate a pregnancy (Finer *et al.*, 2005, 112; Kirkman *et al*., 2009, 373). Project Prevention's stated aim of reducing the suffering of children born to addicts is thus shared by some women who, once pregnant, seek abortion for reasons concerning the well-being, or lack of it, of the potential future child.

Concerns about alcohol, tobacco and drug use by women during pregnancy feature amongst reasons for seeking abortion. Substance-abuse-related reasons for abortion relate, not only to damage done to the foetus during pregnancy, but also to possible postpartum drug use by women and their partners. Substance abuse was identified as a reason to abort by 5% of the nearly 1000 respondents in a U.S. survey undertaken between 2008 and 2010; women mentioned it as a factor which would detract from their parental skills and their ability to provide an environment in which a child would thrive (Roberts et al., 2012, 642). There is a strong association between drug use and abortion, whereby illegal drug use is more strongly correlated to abortion than is the use of legally available drugs (Taft et al., 2019, 139). Some of the survey respondents who consider abortion for drug-related reasons will have similar profiles to those of Project Prevention's clients prior to being sterilized. Those respondents whose reason for abortion is related to their partner's drug use, however, are not necessarily drug users themselves, and the studies cited do not allow one to differentiate the women's drug use from that of their partners.

In the previous section, I cited a third end pursued by Project Prevention, namely, the end of avoiding emotional pain to mothers who have a child removed from their care. This does not feature explicitly in women's reasons for seeking abortion. This reason might be included in women's assessment of their envisaged competence and readiness to be a parent, for any factor which might constitute a reason for thinking one would be a “bad parent” can induce solicitude about losing custody over one's child. Again, the categories which structure the data do not allow for the fine-grained differentiation required for identifying a desire to avoid the aforementioned emotional pain as a reason for abortion.

The evidence on abortion is of some, but limited, use in illuminating the reasons why addicts might seek to be sterilized for money. Of the reasons for abortion mentioned above, none is obviously devoid of the responsibility and care that Sandel admonishes women to exercise in using their reproductive systems. Whether one is prompted to terminate a pregnancy on account of concern for oneself, one's education or career, for the unborn child, one's extant children or intimate partner, there is nothing irresponsible or uncaring in the deliberations about abortion. Sandel, though, would have a retort to this contention, to wit: granted, many of these reasons for abortion manifest responsibility and care – toward oneself and others – in the use of one's reproductive capacity, and abortion, when undertaken for these reasons can, no doubt, redound to the interest of women; but the question is not whether women in general have good reasons for abortion but whether *drug-addicted* women are capable of the ratiocination manifested by the mainly non-addicted women whose reasons for abortion are reported in studies. Is it not more reasonable, Sandel would ask, to assume that addicts' deliberation about abortion will be skewed towards undertaking actions which allow them to feed their addiction? Addicts, Sandel might continue, will further their short-term (perceived) interests by grasping the opportunity to earn money, but doing so is likely to come at the expense of their long-term good? If the money received in return for sterilization facilitates the acquisition of drugs, offering addicts money will induce them to do whatever allows them to acquire it without sufficient consideration of interests they have, particularly those of a long-term nature, other than the procurement of drugs. Studies of decision-making amongst addicts suggest that this thought is correct. <sup>7</sup> From time-to-time, studies report addicts electing to have an abortion for the reason that pregnancy and/or motherhood would detract from efforts to rid themselves of addiction (Roberts et al., 2012, 642-643). Such reasons give one prima facie reason to believe that addicts can deliberate rationally about abortion and comes to decisions which are in their long-term interest. But such reasons feature too rarely to allow one to contend that addicts, more generally, are capable of making choices which promotes their long-term interests.

Evidence on abortion, then, bespeaks often well-reasoned and responsible decision-making by women who consider terminating a pregnancy, but such evidence, because it focuses mainly on the reasons of women who are not dependent on drugs, is insufficient to remove the suspicion that specifically drug-addicted women have less well-considered reasons for abortion because their attention is disproportionately occupied by acquiring drugs and the monetary means for doing so. Mercantile reasons, are, as Sandel contends, not obviously in women's interest.
