## *Sterilization*
Often, sterilization follows from a woman's ascertaining that she does not wish to have (further) children. The relative reliability of sterilization as a contraceptive procedure as well as the side-effects of other contraceptive methods account for the relative popularity of sterilization. <sup>8</sup> The irreversibility of tubal ligation, however, can give rise to post-sterilization regret which issues from a change of mind about not wanting to have (further) children, frequently induced by divorce or the death of extant children. The incidence of regret is higher amongst women below the age of 30 than amidst their post-30-year-old counterparts (Hillis et al., 1999, 891-892; Shreffler et al., 2015). A further factor correlated with post-sterilization regret concerns the process through which the decision to be sterilized goes: those women who exercise less control over the decision are more likely to experience regret. Because it is relevant to an assessment of cash for sterilization in a way which will become apparent below, the issue of control of decision-making which leads to sterilization requires closer examination.

Following Shreffler et al. (2015, 36-37), who explored reasons for sterilization in the United States, one may posit a continuum between “voluntary” and “involuntary” reasons for sterilization. At the voluntary end of the continuum stand reasons which accord with the preferences of women, such as not wishing to have (further) children. A decision based on this reason is voluntary in the sense that it is free of external necessity; it not forced on women but one they can make with maximal autonomy. At the opposite, involuntary, end of the spectrum are decisions based on necessity or compulsion. Forced sterilization, in which women have no choice, has been common in recent history, though it is not the sort of involuntariness with which we are presently concerned (see Bruinius, 2006; Patel, 2017). Paradigmatic for sterilization based on necessity are

<sup>7</sup>See behavioural studies of addicts decision-making, e.g. Heshmat (2015). “Present bias” is a common flaw of decision-making amongst those who are not addicted to drugs and it is a reason for casting aspersion on the ethical permissibility of offering money in exchange for sterilization (Heil *et al*., 2012).

cases in which further procreation might be life threatening for a woman who elects to be sterilized to avoid the risk. Between these poles lie reasons which make the sterilization decision more or less voluntary, depending on the degree autonomy a woman feels she has in making the decision. Sterilization for the reason a woman feels unable to shoulder the financial burden of rearing children would fall between the poles. <sup>9</sup>

One factor which detracts from the voluntariness of the decision to be sterilized is “pressure from others”, be those others husbands (intimate partners), family members or medical practitioners. The odds of reporting post-sterilization regret are highest amongst women who agree to sterilization as a result of pressure from others (Shreffler *et al*., 2015, 42; Boring *et al.*, 1988; Brault *et al*., 2016). A similar finding is met in studies of abortion, whereby “pressure from a male partner” was the reason most strongly associated with retrospective feelings of a negative nature toward the decision to abort (Broen *et al*., 2005, 41). A further indicator of lack of autonomy is the degree of misinformation women have about sterilization, and this factor, too, is positively correlated with post-sterilization regret (Borrero *et al.*, 2012).

The lack of autonomy associated with choices made under pressure diminishes the extent to which one “owns” the choice in question. This applies, not only to women whose decision to be sterilized is urged upon them by an intimate partner, doctor or family member, but also to those whose circumstances dragoon them into acceding to sterilization. Such are the circumstances of many addicts, whose craving for drugs induces them to consent to actions which will facilitate their access to drugs. Sandel holds that the money Project Prevention offers to addicts “may be too tempting to resist. Given her addiction and, in most cases, her poverty, her choice to be sterilized for $300 may not really be free. She may be coerced, in effect, by the necessity of her circumstances” (45). Although Sandel does not explore in detail the circumstances under which circumstances coerce, he traverses well-trodden philosophical territory when he argues that straitened circumstances detract from the voluntariness of choice. The point is voiced by many who comment on financial incentives in healthcare, including on Project Prevention's methods (Ashcroft, 2011; Chelian, 2003-4; Morgan, 2004;Voigt, 2017;Wild and Pratt, 2017).

The extent to which addicts' decisions are truly voluntary is a matter of dispute (Foddy and Savulescu, 2006; Racine and Rousseau-Lesage, 2017). Yet the empirical relationship between less autonomy of choice and post-sterilization regret suggests that addicts who accept Project Prevention's offer are more likely to feel regret as a result of consenting to sterilization under conditions which denudes their choice of autonomy. This gives content to Sandel's claim that addicts act against their interest when they are coerced by addiction and poverty into agreeing to be sterilized; for by doing so, addicts are exposing themselves to post-sterilization regret which, in turn, indicates that, when they give their consent, they fail to judge their long-term interest correctly. This is what makes cash for sterilization illicit, and, on account of its illicitness, it represents bribery, for which our third, and hitherto elusive condition, was that the act performed by the addict, like the delivery of the crooked verdict by the judge, be illicit.
