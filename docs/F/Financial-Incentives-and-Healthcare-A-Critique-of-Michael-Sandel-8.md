## CONCLUSION: COERCION AND CORRUPTION – A REFRAIN
If the train of thought with which I closed the previous section vindicates Sandel's critique of cash for sterilization, he has scored a somewhat Pyrrhic victory, for his argument that cash for sterilization be an instance of bribery relies on the notion of coercion; it is, to reiterate, a combination of addiction and limited financial resources which compromise addicts' autonomy in deciding whether to be sterilized for money, and this makes their act illicit in the sense that it does not redound to their interest. However, the charge of bribery, in Sandel's view, aligns itself with the concept of corruption and is conceptually independent of coercion. Sandel repeatedly states that the corruption objection would remain even if all concerns about coercion and the voluntariness of choice were removed. But corruption, if it plays a role at all in the objection to cash for sterilization, stands on the shoulders of the coercion objection without which the corruption objection is not compelling.

<sup>9</sup>An interesting, though troubling, reason for sterilization is used in plea bargaining, whereby if a guilty party agrees to sterilization, she or he will receive a lenient sentence (see Riley, 2006). Such practices presumably compromise the voluntariness of the sterilization decision.

Sandel is unlikely to be enamoured of a critique of cash for sterilization that relies, as the foregoing analysis does, on the concept of autonomy; for autonomy is a concept he associates with the “proceduralism” of modern liberal political theory which prizes the ability of autonomous individuals to make free choices over ends according to the value that they place on those ends. The procedural nature of modern liberalism circumvents collective discussions about the “norms [which] should govern our sexual and procreative lives” (47) and instead leaves it to individuals to make their own valuations and choices in matters deemed to be private. <sup>10</sup> Sandel's contribution to such collective discussion is, however, insufficient as a basis for establishing grounds which might help us to decide which norms are appropriate. In particular, his conception of women's interest and of the circumstances under which cash for sterilization thwarts their interest is underdeveloped. Hence he is unable to ground his corruption-based objection to the use of monetary incentives, for the objection from corruption requires thorough analysis of the correct attitude one should cultivate toward one's health and the interests which the adoption of this attitude serves. In lieu of more compelling arguments about such matters, we may be left with no criterion for assessing cash for sterilization other than according to the degree of autonomy accorded to addicts who agree to sterilization. This assessment draws its strength from the concept of coercion, not from the concept of corruption.
