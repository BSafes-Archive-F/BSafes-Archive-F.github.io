## ABSTRACT

As technology boomed at the end of the 20th Century and into the 21st Century, the methods young adults use to manage their finances have also evolved. Between moving financial investing and banking to the internet, robo-advising apps, college debt, and the generational reaction to the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world of investing has taken a drastic turn when it comes to young investors. The purpose of this study is to examine the financial habits of Generation Z in order for financial planning companies to better market to the upcoming Generation Z. A survey was used for this study to gather information on the habits and literacy of Generation Z (the survey pool was Bryant University students that fall in the Generation Z age range). The results show that Bryant is slightly skewed to conservative values, and as a result sways from Millennials when it comes to considering political leanings of companies while investing (Generation Z is less likely to care about politics of companies).  The survey also revealed that Generation Z is primarily concerned with profit making, and this is likely instilled in them by their parents because the average age for opening a bank account according to the survey is approximately seven years old. 

As this study went on, it became apparent the surveyed group of Bryant students greatly swayed the data. Both with the financial and political backgrounds of the students affecting the results, in addition to the investing culture on campus, the overall study shifted from Generation Z to Bryant Students, who are currently members of Generation Z.
